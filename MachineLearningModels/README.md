# Machine Learning Models
Benajmin Lam of Newcastle University wrote a base script (HLAF T2D Analysis- 84K (T2D vs Norm 0) FINAL.ipynb) for the whole HLAF Dataset, I was tasked at interpretting and plugging in the aggregated datasets and producing some additional feature information from the models.
